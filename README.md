Mod pack based on the famous Krumpac Reforged mod pack with PREMIUM license, see https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Krumpac/Krumpac_Reforge_Core/

*WARNING*: this mod pack requires a Krumpac Reforged PREMIUM license to be able to even start the game, game will simply quit if you didn't get the PREMIUM license set up previously. For getting the premium license you can get informations from https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Krumpac/Krumpac_Reforge_Core/ or join the discord to get more information: https://discord.gg/9czyeGpq 

## Is this mod pack "Krumpac Reforged"?

Answer: No, [Krumpac Reforged Core](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Krumpac/Krumpac_Reforge_Core/) is the orignial mod pack from Krumpac. This mod pack here
is NOT affiliated with the autor and will just provide a couple of other mods (QoL, skills, ...) in a configured fashion with the original mod pack. I do use this mod pack especially to run my private server with it and provide it to other players that also want to do so.
