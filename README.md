Mod pack based on the famous Krumpac Reforged mod pack which requires REGISTRATION to become part of the closed BETA testing community, see https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Krumpac/Krumpac_Reforge_Core/

*WARNING*: this mod pack requires a Krumpac Reforged REGISTRATION to be able to even start the game, game will simply quit if you didn't approved registration previously. For becoming part of the closed BETA testing community you can get informations from https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Krumpac/Krumpac_Reforge_Core/ or join the discord to get more information: https://discord.gg/9czyeGpq 

## Is this mod pack "Krumpac Reforged"?

Answer: No, [Krumpac Reforged Core](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Krumpac/Krumpac_Reforge_Core/) is the orignial mod pack from Krumpac. This mod pack here is NOT affiliated with the autor and will just provide a couple of other mods (QoL, skills, ...) in a configured fashion with the original mod pack. I do use this mod pack especially to run my private server with it and provide it to other players that also want to do so. 

# Game play

## Keybinds explained

* X (+W) dive or surface, depending on view angle
* Y rest in water (but seems buggy)
* C/V/B -> equipment bar (you need to change some default keys to use)
* F/G -> forsaken powers activation
* N (in build mode) activate build camera
* O/P use auto storage functions
